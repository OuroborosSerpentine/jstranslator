## jTranslator - JavaScript Translator ##
A JavaScript to Human-Readable-English translator.

Take any JavaScript file and put it through jtranslator.js to understand how the code works in plain English.

### Problem Definition ###
Whilst reading JavaScript, in my mind I am constantly translating the code into human english, so I decided in true programmer-lazy fashion to write a script to do this "translating" for me automatically. It will also probably help those new to JavaScript to help understand the language better.  

### How It Works ###
The script uses regular expressions to count, find and replace code. Simples.

### To Do ###
* Use [esprima.js](http://esprima.org/) for wider code coverage and more accurate translations
* Add in support for multiple, custom translations
* Use popular libraries such as jQuery, Backbone.js as a litmus test
